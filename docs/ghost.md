## Webhook events

If your Home Assistant instance is accessible via HTTPS (e.g., via Nabu Casa), the integration will automatically create webhooks in Ghost to receive real-time events:

|-------|-------------|
| `ghost_member_added` | Fired when a new member signs up |
| `ghost_member_deleted` | Fired when a member is removed |
| `ghost_post_published` | Fired when a post is published |
| `ghost_post_unpublished` | Fired when a post is unpublished |

These events can be used in automations.

## Example automations

### Notify when a new member signs up

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "New Ghost member notification"
    trigger:
      - trigger: event
        event_type: ghost_member_added
    action:
      - action: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "New subscriber!"
          message: "{{ trigger.event.data.name or trigger.event.data.email }} just signed up"
```

### Announce milestone member counts

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Member milestone celebration"
    trigger:
      - trigger: state
        entity_id: sensor.my_ghost_site_total_members
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ trigger.to_state.state | int % 100 == 0 }}"
    action:
      - action: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "🎉 Milestone reached!"
          message: "You now have {{ trigger.to_state.state }} members!"
```
